# Overview of my python-learning-journey
This repository documents my Python learninjourney as I build a strong programming foundation for my transition into AI Engineering and AI Product Engineering.

I’m currently following the “Complete Python Bootcamp: From Zero to Hero” by Jose Portilla on Udemy, using Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook as my development environment.

The goal of this repo is to track my learning progress, showcase my hands-on practice notebooks, and share code snippets related to AI, Data Science, Machine Learning, and automation concepts as I advance in my AI roadmap.
